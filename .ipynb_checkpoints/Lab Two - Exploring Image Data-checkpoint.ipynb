Making the visuals is not enough to satisfy each of the rubrics belowâ€”you should appropriately explain what the implications of the visualizations are. In other words, expect about 20% of the available points for visuals that have no substantive discussion. "

Rather than using matching on the images with the total DAISY vector, you will instead use key point matching. You will need to investigate appropriate methods for key point matching using DAISY. NOTE: this often requires some type of brute force matching per pair of images, which can be computationally expensive."
